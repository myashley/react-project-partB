## Client

  ![Client logo](assets/images/encode-talent-logo.jpg)

  Encode Talent Management provides career advocacy services for Australiaâ€™s premier IT and Digital professionals. 

  The person of contact was **Simon Cook**. He is the recruitment principal for Encode Talent Management. His main emphasis is on understanding his candidates' (people looking for work) qualities, career goals and aspirations before matching them with clients (employers seeking employees)

  ## Problem
  A major part of Simon's work is dealing with candidates via phone calls, where he runs an extensive questionnaire to get as much information about them as possible. He spends 75% of his time on the phone and documents all his data manually in his notebook and then manually enters the data into an Excel spreadsheet

  Relying on a combination of Excel, Hubspot, written notes and his own memory, he matches candidates with clients, conducting further meetings to gather more information from candidates if necessary. He has become overwhelmed by the great amount of work and is struggling to keep things in order and so he has reached out to us for a solution. 
  
  ## Solution
  After our first meeting with Simon, we decided that the best solution is to have part of his work automated. We figured an online solution will help solve his problems and increase efficiency.
  
  To solve his problem, we built an app that will feature a questionnaire that his candidates can fill out. He can view all their responses once they submit. He will have a database of all the candidates who submitted the questionnaire and will be able to filter through them accodrding to his needs. He can also export the candidates' data as a CSV file. This will dramatically reduce the amount of time used for phone calls and help him better keep track of all his candidates.

  
  ## The App
  The app was built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJs and NodeJs) stack. We used Node.js as a runtime environment to build this app, and React as our JavaScript library/framework to develop the frontend. We used Express framework for our backend, and connected to MongoDB database by using Mongoose as our driver.

  We have two frontends; one for the candidate questionnaire form and one for the Admin user to view the candidate submissions. 
  
  The app consists of two major components: candidates and admininstrator. The candidate information is collected, validated and stored into the database, and the administrator has access to the data for further management and manipulation. The candidate form and admin view are on 2 separate URLs.

  ### Candidates Form
  This is the functional form we built for the client. It is broken into different sections and the candidates will be asked to fill out each section and answer all the questions in this form. The candidates do not have to sign-in / sign-up to fill out the form. Once they have filled and submitted the form, the form will reload and will be ready for a new submission. 

  ### Administrator view
  The admin has access to the form data filled out by each candidate. The admin can view all the submission content of the candidates'. The admin can also export this data as a CSV file. The admin user must be authorised in order to access this data, therefore they will be asked to login in before they are granted access. 

  ### Validation
  We used the following:
  - 'react-validation-mixin'
  - 'joi-validation-strategy'
  - 'joi-browser'

  These were used for the validation of data for each section of the form. This ensures that candidates fill out each section of the form. The form cannot be submitted unless it is fully validated. 

  ### Testing
  Due to the time constraints given for the project, we are unable to incorporate a fully test driven development scheme. However, tests were written for the functional client-end components to ensure that features built for client interaction worked. We used Jest as our testing framework for its simplicity and speedy performance.

  ### Tools used  
  - **Trello:** This help us implement an agile approach throughout the project. We were able to document our progress and keep all our project resources in one place. We used it to keep track of each task and sprint.

  - **Database Schema:**
    Here is the schema for our database:

  - **Wireframes:** We used figma for all our design planning. It is a powerful tool that allows for effective team collaboration and design. 

    Below are images of our designs:

  - **Workflow Diagram:** We used an online   software called Draw io. It has full       functionality to draw and label diagrams.
  
    Below is the workflow diagram for the app:

### Pain Points 

- JWT Auth for admin user:
  One of the problems we faced with the Admin view, was with the routing. Once logged in and authorised, the admin can view the candidates, however when logging out, the admin isn't redirected back to the login form. This is due to an error in our express backend routes. Due to time constraints, we were unable to fix this problem. 

### Github 
  We used github to collaborate and share our code. Each time a new feature was added, it was pushed up to github and merged into the master branch. Github was used to securely save our code. Throughout the project, we learnt a lot about using the github commands and functions; things like forking,pull requests, branching and merging. 

### Future development

There is plenty of room for improvement. There were a lot of features we would have liked to add but due to time constraints, we were unable to include everything. The app has a lot of potential to help many people, and with the right support, it can be used as a commercial product.

### Project Review

This project has been a great learning experience. I really enjoyed working in the team environment and learnt a lot about myself as well. I feel a great sense of self-accomplishment after completing this app, and am more motivated than ever to keep building new things to make other people's lives easier. I had a great time working with my team, we worked well with each other and I feel like we established a special bond that will last a lifetime. I look forward to future development and teamwork in the industry, I am now confident I can make a solid contribution to any project and team."
